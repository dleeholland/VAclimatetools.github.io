## Problem
Problem Context:
Domain of problem: Climate Change/Climate Hazards
Importance of problem:  
Climate change has caused many climate hazards to take place over the years. These climate hazards include stormwater, heatwaves, and vector-borne diseases. The following list describes the negative impact each climate hazard has on society.
Stormwater – Climate change has caused an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall, which has triggered flash flooding. Flashing flooding results in the disruption of transportation, damaging infrastructure, destroying property, and threatening lives.
Heatwaves – Climate change has caused in increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme heat in the mid-Atlantic. This has resulted in degrading air quality, frequent health emergencies, and incurring costs (lost of workdays and higher electricity bills) 
Vector-borne disease – Climate changes has caused the reduction of winter weather, which has resulted in disease vectors (ticks, mosquitoes) to survive in large numbers. This leads to an increase in Lyme disease and West Nile virus, and other diseases that are threatening human health and lives [1].

Problem Statement: 
Over the years, climate change has made many noticeable impacts,
especially within climate hazards. There are large amounts of data to
show the massive impacts of climate change, but there are many
issues faced when collecting the proper information. The
information is often hard to access, too great in size, in an unusable
format, and at too high of scale. It is important to be able to access
and use this data as it will allow municipal planners to plan and
prepare municipalities for any negative impacts of climate change.
